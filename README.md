# Postman-Trello
Trello API simulation via Postman

In this Collection I have Created a board, Added two Lists ToDo and Done.
After that I created a card in Todo list and moved the card from ToDo to Done list.
And then deleted current board.
After deleting the board I have retrived all the boards which might be present and have diverted the flow back to delete API.
Once all boards are deleted Postman stops sending requests to the API.
